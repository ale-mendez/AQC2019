\begin{abstract}
We investigate the feasibility of using pseudopotentials to generate
the bound and continuum orbitals needed in collisional calculations. 
By examination of several inelastic processes in the first Born 
approximation, we demonstrate the inconveniences of this approach. 
Instead, we advocate use of effective potentials obtained with 
the depurated inversion method (DIM). In this contribution, we 
extend this method to molecular systems. Calculations of 
single first--order photoionisation and proton--impact ionisation with 
DIM show good agreement with experimental results for both atoms and
molecules.

\section{Outline}

Inelastic transition calculations require the representation of 
the bound and continuum states involved in the collisional processes. 
The hypothetical existence of an effective one--electron local 
potential accounting for these states would allow more direct
generation of the orthogonal wavefunctions for the interacting 
particles. This approach should include individual $nl$--orbital 
potentials, a feature missing in most of the standard density 
functional methods. The idea of replacing a many--body, nonlocal 
interaction by an effective one--electron equation opens up the 
possibility of studying extremely complex systems with high accuracy. 

In this context, one promising idea emerges from the pseudopotential
approximation (PPA), in which all the complexity of the wavefunctions 
near the core --that usually consumes a huge numerical effort-- is 
avoided. For instance, density functional theory codes using 
pseudopotentials, such as the {\sc parsec}, for 
example~\cite{parsecwebpage,Chelikowsky1994}, permit the use of an 
equally--spaced grid involving a relatively small number of points. 
Otherwise, the use of realistic potentials describing the nucleus 
Coulomb potential requires a high density of points concentrated at 
the origin to describe what the pseudopotentials cast aside. Thus, if 
PPA were applicable in the field of collision theory, one would save 
an enormous amount of computational resources.

Another interesting approach is the depurated inversion method 
(DIM) \cite{Mendez2015,Mendez2016,Mendez2018}, which allows accurate, 
effective potentials to be obtained by substituting the coupled 
multielectron equations into a Kohn--Sham type equation. In the first 
step, the potential is obtained through inversion of the 
one--electron equation. Next, a careful optimisation of the potential 
is carried out, eliminating poles, and imposing the appropriate 
boundary conditions analytically. In that way, the DIM potentials are 
parametrised in simple analytical expressions.

In the present work, we explore the possibility of implementing an 
effective potential approximation in the atomic collision theory to 
describe inelastic processes. In particular, we examine several 
collisional processes involving a single electron transition: 
photoionisation, excitation, ionisation and electron capture. 
A wide variety of {\it ab initio} methods have been implemented to
compute scattering cross sections for atomic targets, from the 
early implementations of the first Born approximation 
(FBA)~\cite{Bates1962,McDowell1961}, to more sophisticated fully
quantum mechanical methods, e.g., 
\cite{Pindzola2007,Burke2011,Bray2017,Pindzola2016}. 
Whether for atoms or molecules, we shall present cross sections and 
compare with some experimental data. We do not wish, here, to present 
a detailed comparison with other existing calculations. The main 
purpose is to illustrate the effective use of the DIM in collision 
applications. To this end, several simplifications are made: (1) The calculations are constrained to Hamiltonians describing only the 
moving projectile, the target and the active electron; (2) The 
transition matrix elements are only considered in first perturbative 
order. If the first order fails, it would not make any sense to 
extend the calculation to higher terms of the series. For simplicity, 
we will restrict our calculations only to the FBA framework, which is 
known to give reasonable agreement with the experimental cross 
section in the intermediate--high projectile energy range. Moreover, 
within this energy range and approximation order, the Hartree--Fock 
orbitals are known to provide the correct high energy limit.

We examine the above mentioned inelastic processes for two atoms with 
a single outer electron: hydrogen and lithium. In this context, we 
inspect the influence of the target description in the cross sections 
when the PPA and DIM approaches are implemented. Furthermore, these 
effects have been previously studied in other perturbative approaches,
i.e. the continuum distorted wave eikonal--initial--state (CDW-EIS), 
for various targets (for example, see~\cite{Kirchner1998,Fiori2001}).
The DIM approach is further tested in the case of many--electron 
atoms by comparing photoionisation cross sections with experimental 
measurements. 

On the other hand, the description of molecular systems constitutes 
a real challenge due to their nonspherical symmetry and multicenter 
character. Many \textit{ab initio} and semi--empirical theoretical 
approximations \cite{Szabo1996,Helgaker2000,Schaefer2004} have been 
developed to this end over the last century. In this work, we present 
an extension of the DIM method for simple molecular systems, 
providing a new parametric expression for the potentials. The target 
description is once again tested by examination of its performance in 
first--order collisional processes, and the methane molecule being 
taken as an example.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Pseudopotential Approximation}
\label{sec:PPAs}

The pseudopotential approximation consists in replacing the Coulomb 
potential in the many--electron system Hamiltonian with a smooth 
function so that the electron wavefunctions oscillating rapidly in 
the core region are replaced by nodeless pseudo--orbitals having the 
right energy and the same outer range properties.
In general, the pseudopotentials $V_{\mbox{\tiny PP}}$ can be defined 
through a pseudo--charge $Z_{\mbox{\tiny PP}}$ as
\begin{equation}
 V_{\mbox{\tiny PP}}(r)=-\frac{Z_{\mbox{\tiny PP}}(r)}{r} \,,
 \label{eq:pseudopotential}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 Z_{\mbox{\tiny PP}}(r)=\bigg\{
 \begin{array}{cl}
  f(r), & r\leq r_c \\
  1, & r>r_c 
 \end{array} 
 \,,
 \label{eq:pseudocharge}
\end{equation}
where $r_c$ is a cutoff radius that separates the core, $r\leq r_c$,
from the valence region, $r>r_c$, of the target and $f(r)$ is a 
continuous function with a constant value at the origin.
Fig.~\ref{fig:pseudoLi} illustrates a pseudopotential (solid line)
and its corresponding pseudo--wavefunction for the $3s$ orbital of 
argon. Notice that the pseudopotential behaves as $-r^{-1}$ 
(dot--dash line) in the valence region, as defined in 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:pseudopotential}) and (\ref{eq:pseudocharge}).
The pseudo--wavefunction agrees with the one--electron Hartree--Fock
(HF) orbital (dashed line) in the outer region, losing all 
information about the atomic structure close to the origin.

 \caption{(a) Pseudopotential, (b) pseudo--wavefunction and 
 HF orbital for the $3s$ orbital of argon.}
 \label{fig:pseudoLi}
\end{figure}

In Section~\ref{sec:colproc}, we analyse the feasibility of 
implementing pseudopotentials in collisional processes calculations 
for two simple atomic targets: hydrogen and lithium. For each atom, 
the following pseudopotentials are examined
\begin{equation}
 \begin{array}{clll}
  \mbox{Name} & \mbox{Source} & \mbox{Type} & \mbox{Ref.} \\
  \hline  
  A & \mbox{\sc abinit} & \mbox{GGA} & \cite{abinitwebpage,Hamann1979} \\
  P & \mbox{\sc parsec} & \mbox{Troullier Martins} & \cite{parsecwebpage,Chelikowsky1994}\,.
 \end{array}
 \label{eq:pseudosources}
\end{equation}
The hydrogen atom has only one electron, and the corresponding 
pseudopotential is not essential. However, the hydrogen 
pseudopotentials from (\ref{eq:pseudosources}) reproduce with high 
accuracy the main features of the wavefunctions, even for excited 
states.

We will now proceed to examine the pseudo--charges and its 
one--electron solutions for the lithium atom closely. First, we study 
the spatial and momentum representation of the pseudo--charges. The 
momentum--space equivalent of $Z(r)$ is given by the Fourier 
transform
\begin{equation}
 \widetilde{Z}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} 
 Z(r)\,e^{-ikr}\,dr\,.
\end{equation}
The pseudo--charges from~(\ref{eq:pseudosources}) for the $2s$ 
orbital of lithium are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ZLi}. For 
comparison, we include the potential attained from implementing the 
depurated inversion method described in Section~\ref{sec:DIM}. The 
pseudo--charges vanish at the origin, avoiding the divergence of the 
Coulomb potential. However, this feature comes at a price: the 
pseudo--charges in the spatial representation are repulsive around 
\mbox{$r= $1 a.u.}, and their momentum picture fails to represent the 
target for high $k$, showing an incorrect oscillatory behaviour for 
values greater than $k_c=(2\pi r_c)^{-1}\sim0.7$ a.u..
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{figures/pseudopot/ZLi.eps}
\hspace{0.2cm}
 \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{figures/pseudopot/ZLik.eps}
 \caption{Pseudo and DIM charges for the $2s$ orbital of lithium. 
 (a) Spatial and (b) momentum representation.}
 \label{fig:ZLi}
\end{figure}

Secondly, we inspect the behaviour of the bound pseudo--orbitals 
obtained from solving the one--electron Schr\"odinger equation with a 
pseudopotential. As usual, the bound state wavefunctions can be 
written as
\begin{equation}
 \psi_{nlm}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{u_{nl}(r)}{r}Y_l^m(\hat{r})\,,
 \label{eq:centralfield-wave}
\end{equation}
where $u_{nl}(r)$ are the reduced radial wavefunctions, and 
$Y_l^m(\hat{r})$ are the spherical harmonics. Similarly, the Fourier 
transform of these functions is given by
\begin{equation}
 \widetilde{\psi}_{nlm}(\mathbf{k}) =
 \frac{\chi_{nl}(k)}{k}Y_l^m(\hat{k})\,.
\end{equation}

The spatial and momentum representations of the $2s$ radial 
pseudo--wavefunctions of lithium corresponding to the pseudo--charges 
from~(\ref{eq:pseudosources}) are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:wavesLi}.
Although the pseudo--orbitals are very different from the DIM $2s$ 
wavefunction, the transformed $\chi(k)$ seems to have similar 
characteristics. However, a closer inspection of the tail region of 
these functions (see the inset of the figure) shows the existence of 
several nodes. We will see later that these discrepancies have 
significant consequences in the cross sections for most of the 
collisional processes examined.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{figures/pseudopot/funcLi.eps}
\hspace{0.2cm}
 \includegraphics[height=0.23\textheight]{figures/pseudopot/funckLi.eps}
 \caption{Pseudo and DIM bound state wavefunction for the $2s$ 
 orbital of lithium in (a) spatial and (b) momentum representation.}
 \label{fig:wavesLi}
\end{figure}

Finally, the pseudopotential approach not only affects the 
representation of the bound orbitals but also determines the form of 
the continuum wavefunctions. For large $r$, the free state orbitals 
of an electron in the presence of a Coulomb potential can be written 
as
\begin{equation}
 u_{kl}(r) \rightarrow \,\sin \left( kr - l\frac{\pi}{2} - \eta \ln 2kr +
 \sigma_l + \delta_l \right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the particle wave number, $\eta$ is Sommerfeld's 
parameter, $\sigma_l$ is the Coulomb phase shift and $\delta_l$ is 
the wave phase shift with respect to the Coulomb wave.

Comparisons between the DIM (solid line) and the pseudo (dashed)
continuum $ks$ wavefunctions for lithium are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:contLi}, close to the origin (left) and asymptotically 
(right). The pseudo and DIM wavefunctions behave similarly far away 
from the nucleus. The asymptotic phase shift $\Delta$ accounts for 
the differences between the potentials. As the energy of the free 
electron increases, $\Delta$ diminishes. However, the orbitals in the 
core region are different even with increasing energy; the first 
maximum of the DIM wavefunctions are consistently smaller than of the 
pseudo--orbitals, which is understood since the Coulomb--type 
attraction of the nuclei is stronger than the pseudopotential in that 
region.

\subsection{Depurated Inversion Method Potentials}
\label{sec:DIM}

The depurated inversion method \cite{Mendez2015,Mendez2016,Mendez2018} 
consists of assuming that the many--electron atom orbitals can be 
represented by the solution of Kohn--Sham type equations, in which 
the $nl$ effective potentials are given by 
\begin{equation}
V_{nl}(r) = 
\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{u_{nl}(r)}
\frac{d^2u_{nl}(r)}{dr^{2}} - 
\frac{l(l+1)}{2r^{2}}+\varepsilon_{nl} \, ,
\label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
where $u_{nl}$ and $\varepsilon_{nl}$ are the $nl$ orbital 
wavefunctions and energies, respectively. In this work, the atomic 
structure is approximated with the Hartree--Fock method, which is 
computed with the {\sc hf} codes by C. Froese 
Fischer~\cite{FroeseFischer1997} and the {\sc nrhf} code by 
W. Johnson~\cite{Johnson2007}. The computation of Eq.~(\ref{eq:V}) 
poses various numerical problems. The nodes and asymptotic decay of 
the wavefunctions $u_{nl}(r)$ introduce significant numerical errors 
in the inversion procedure (see Ref.~\cite{Mendez2018} for further 
details). The nodes of the orbitals produce huge unphysical poles, 
while the rapid asymptotic decay of the internal wavefunctions 
generates large divergences in the tail region of the potentials. 
The depuration method is implemented to tackle these unphysical 
features. An effective potential with a Coulomb--type shape 
$V_r(r)=-Z_r(r)/r$ is defined, and we enforce the correct boundary 
conditions fitting the inverted potential with the following 
analytical expression
\begin{equation}
 Z_r(r) = \sum_{j=1}^n z_j e^{-\alpha_j r}(1+\beta_jr) + 1
 \, \longrightarrow \, \bigg\{
 \begin{array}{cc}
  Z_N, & r\rightarrow0 \\
  1, & r\rightarrow\infty 
 \end{array}
 \label{eq:atomiczDIM}
\end{equation} 
where \mbox{$\sum z_j = Z_N-1$} ($Z_N$ here stands for the nuclear 
charge). The parameters $\alpha_j$ and $\beta_j$ are optimised to 
reproduce the HF values accurately.

\section{Collisional Processes in Atoms}
\label{sec:colproc}

The most significant advantage of the pseudopotential method is its 
simplicity. However, it is worth to determine the validity of this 
approach when used for computing collisional processes. In this 
Section, we perform a thorough examination of the pseudo--potentials 
for hydrogen and lithium by comparing the cross sections of four 
inelastic processes: proton--impact excitation, proton--impact 
ionisation, charge exchange and photoionisation. The initial and 
final states of the targets are obtained by solving the corresponding 
Schr\"odinger equation. For the hydrogen atom, we compare the 
pseudopotential results with the exact analytical solutions. 
Furthermore, in order to assess the applicability of the depurated 
inversion method, we compute the photoionisation of more complex 
many--electron atoms and compare our findings with experimental data.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proton--Impact Excitation}

The proton--impact excitation of target $X$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
 \mbox{H}^+ + X \rightarrow \mbox{H}^+ + X^*\,.
\end{equation}
The excitation cross section $\sigma$ of the target from the initial
bound state $\psi_i$ to the excited state $\psi_{\!f}$ may be written
as 
\begin{equation}
 \sigma=\frac{\mu^2}{4\pi^2}\frac{k_{\!f}}{k_i}\int{\left|T_{\!fi}\right|^2 
 d\Omega}\,,
  \label{eq:cross-section}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the proton--atom system, 
$\mathbf{k}_i$ and $\mathbf{k}_{\!f}$ are the initial and final 
relative momenta, and 
\begin{equation}
 T_{\!fi}=\langle \psi_{\!f}|V|\psi_i\rangle
 \label{eq:transition-matrix}
\end{equation}
is the transition matrix or T--matrix.
If the initial and final states of the transition are described by 
the Hartree--Fock method, the orbitals will give the correct high 
energy limit in the first order approximation (this is not the case 
for the charge exchange process). Hence, we will concentrate our 
computing efforts in the first perturbative order of the transition
matrix element through the FBA, given by
\begin{equation}
 T_{\!fi}^{\mbox{\scriptsize FBA}} = \widetilde{V}(\mathbf{p}) F_{\!fi}(\mathbf{p}) \,.
 \label{eq:firstbornTmatrix}
\end{equation}
The term $F_{\!fi}(\mathbf{p})$ is the form--factor
\begin{equation}
 F_{fi}(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} 
 \int{\widetilde{\psi}_{\!f}^*(\mathbf{k})
 \widetilde{\psi}_i(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{p})\,d\mathbf{k}}\,,
 \label{eq:form-factor}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momentum transfer vector
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{p} = p_{\mbox{\tiny min}} \hat{\mathbf{v}} + \boldsymbol{\eta} \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 p_{\mbox{\tiny min}} = \frac{\varepsilon_{\!f}-\varepsilon_i}{v} \rightarrow 
 \bigg\{
 \begin{array}{cl}
  \infty, &v\rightarrow 0 \\
  0, &v\rightarrow \infty
 \end{array}
 \,,
 \label{eq:pmin}
\end{equation}
$\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ is the ion velocity, $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ is
the transversal momentum transfer, so that 
$\hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\eta}=0$, whereas $\varepsilon_i$ 
and $\varepsilon_{\!f}$ are the binding energies corresponding to the 
initial and final states. 
A more comprehensive formulation of the FBA can be found, for 
instance, in Ref.~\cite{McDowell1970}. 

The first Born proton--impact excitation cross sections of hydrogen 
and lithium from the ground states are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exHLi}.
The pseudopotential results for the $f_1=2s,\,2p$ and 
$f_2=3s,\,3p,\,3d$ final states of hydrogen agree excellently with 
the analytical expression. For lithium, the pseudopotential cross 
sections agree in a broad velocity range with the DIM calculations, 
except for low proton--impact velocities. This disagreement arises 
from the form factor. For low impact velocities, the momentum 
transfer vector is large (\ref{eq:pmin}). As discussed earlier, in 
this region the bound momentum orbital 
$\widetilde{\psi}(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{p})$ is not described adequately 
by the pseudopotentials. An alternative expression for the form 
factor can be considered by implementing the peaking approximation
\begin{equation}
 F_{\!fi}(\mathbf{p}) \sim \widetilde{\psi}_i(\mathbf{p})\widetilde{\psi}_{\!f}^*(0)
 +\widetilde{\psi}_{\!f}(\mathbf{p})\widetilde{\psi}_i^*(0)\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, in order to have the correct form factor, it is necessary 
to obtain an accurate description of the initial bound state at large 
momentum values, which is not the case for the pseudostates (see 
Fig.~\ref{fig:wavesLi}b) and hence their failure when used in the 
cross section calculation.

 state for hydrogen and lithium.}

\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proton--Impact Ionisation}

The transition matrix (\ref{eq:transition-matrix}) for the 
proton--impact ionisation of $X$,
\begin{equation}
 \mbox{H}^+ + X \rightarrow \mbox{H}^+ + X^+ + e^-\,,
\end{equation}
can also be written in terms of the first order Born approximation. 
In this case, the final state $\psi_{\!f}$ in 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:form-factor}) is an outgoing continuum wavefunction 
$\psi_{\mathbf{k}_{\!f}}^-$, while $\varepsilon_{\!f}=k_{\!f}^2/2$ is 
the energy of the ionised electron. 

The single--differential proton--impact ionisation cross sections 
$d\sigma/d\varepsilon_{\!f}$ of hydrogen and lithium at a proton 
velocity of $v_p=1$\,a.u. are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ionHLi}. In the 
case of hydrogen, the pseudopotential and analytical results agree 
for all the electron energy range, except at very high values. On the 
other hand, for lithium, the cross sections computed with 
pseudopotentials only agree at low energies. Once again, assuming 
that $\psi_{\mathbf{k}_{\!f}}^-(\mathbf{k})$ can be approximated by a 
plane wave, the form factor is reduced to the Fourier transform of 
the initial bound state
\begin{equation}
 F_{\!fi}(\mathbf{p})\sim\widetilde{\psi}_i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}_{\!f})\,.
\end{equation}
Then, as $k_{\!f}$ increases, so does $p_{\mbox{\tiny min}}$, and the 
form factor is not well represented by the pseudopotentials. The 
significant discrepancies shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ionHLi} provide 
another demonstration of how a wrong description of the momentum 
space wavefunction may produce huge errors in collisional processes 
calculations.

 \label{fig:ionHLi}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proton--Impact Charge Exchange}

The proton--impact charge exchange of target $X$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
 \mbox{H}^+ + X \rightarrow \mbox{H} + X^+\,.
\end{equation}
The charge transfer cross section by the collision of a proton 
(electron capture) is computed with the first order Brinkman--Kramers 
approximation~\cite{Brinkman1930}. Accordingly, the matrix element is 
defined by 
\begin{equation}
 T_{\!fi}^{\mbox{\tiny BK}} = \widetilde{\psi}_f^*(\mathbf{W}_{\!f})
 \left[\varepsilon_{\!f}-\frac{W_{\!f}^2}{2} \right]
 \widetilde{\psi}_{\!i}(\mathbf{W}_i)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W}_{\!i}$ and $\mathbf{W}_{\!f}$ are the momentum 
transfer vectors 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{W}_{\!i} = W_{\!i0} \hat{\mathbf{v}} + \boldsymbol{\eta}, \quad 
 W_{\!i0} = \frac{v}{2} - p_{\mbox{\tiny min}}
 \label{eq:momtransfi0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{W}_{\!f} = W_{\!f0} \hat{\mathbf{v}} + \boldsymbol{\eta}, \quad 
 W_{\!f0} = \frac{v}{2} + p_{\mbox{\tiny min}}\,,
 \label{eq:momtransff0}
\end{equation}
and they satisfy the condition $\mathbf{W}_{\!i}+\mathbf{W}_{\!f}=\mathbf{v}$,
and $p_{\mbox{\tiny min}}$ is defined in Eq.~(\ref{eq:pmin}).

The charge exchange cross sections of hydrogen and lithium in the 
ground state are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:captureH}. The cross 
section of hydrogen is described with high accuracy by the 
pseudopotential approach for a wide range of proton velocities. 
However, this process constitutes a symmetrical resonance, i.e. 
$\varepsilon_{\!f}=\varepsilon_{\!i}$, and the agreement may be 
misleading. For the lithium case, the pseudopotentials fail utterly 
to describe the electron capture correctly at low and high velocities.
For low and high $v_p$ values, the momentum transfer vector becomes 
large, and therefore, the cross sections calculated with 
pseudopotentials disagree completely for most of the energy values.
% the cross sections are erroneously calculated 
% with pseudopotentials. The results disagree completely for most of 
% the energy values, except for a minimal range of velocities around 
% $v\simeq0.77$\,a.u..

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Photoionisation}
\label{sec:photoatom}

The single photoionisation is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
 \hbar\omega + X &\rightarrow& X^+ + e\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Considering a perturbative photon field, the initial bound $\psi_{i}$ 
and final continuum $\psi_{\mathbf{k}_{\!f}}^-$ states of the target 
are not considerably distorted; therefore, the relevant matrix 
element of the photoionisation process is given by
\begin{equation}
 T_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mbox{\tiny Ph}} = \int{
 \psi_{\mathbf{k}_{\!f}}^-(\mathbf{r}) 
 \left[-i \hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_\lambda \cdot 
 \boldsymbol{\nabla}_\mathbf{r}\right] 
 \psi_{i}(\mathbf{r})}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_\lambda$ is the polarisation 
versor and $\mathbf{k}_{\!f}=\sqrt{2(\omega+\varepsilon_i)}$, as 
imposed by energy conservation.

The first--order photoionisation cross sections of hydrogen and 
lithium are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:photoHLi}. The pseudopotentials 
results for the hydrogen atom agree with the exact analytical 
expression results only for low photon energies, failing at larger 
values. These discrepancies can be understood considering the 
continuum wavefunction $\psi_{\mathbf{k}_{\!f}}^-(\mathbf{r})$ as a 
plane wave. Consequently, the matrix element 
$T_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mbox{\tiny Ph}}$ is reduced to
\begin{equation}
 T_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mbox{\tiny Ph}} \sim 
 -\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_\lambda \cdot \mathbf{k}_{\!f} \right)
 \widetilde{\psi_i} \left(\mathbf{k}_{\!f}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and it is determined entirely by the behaviour of the bound target 
pseudostate in the momentum representation. For hydrogen, the 
pseudo--orbital from {\sc parsec} in the Fourier space coincides with 
the exact analytical solution for the entire range of $k$, which 
explains the excellent agreement in the cross section results. For 
lithium, the pseudopotential cross sections disagree with the DIM 
results for all energy values. The large oscillations in the cross 
sections are originated by the spurious oscillatory structure of the 
bound state for large $k$ values (see inset of 
Fig.~\ref{fig:wavesLi}b).

\subsection{DIM Photoionisation of Many--electron Atoms}

In order to assess the applicability of the depurated inversion method
for atoms with a more complex structure, we compute the 
photoionisation of many--electron targets with the DIM 
potentials~\cite{Mendez2016} and compare our results with 
experimental values. 
The first order photoionisation cross section of nitrogen and neon 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:photoDIM}. Experimental data 
from~\cite{Henke1993,Samson1990,Samson2002,Stolte2016} is illustrated 
with hollow symbols. The DIM photoionisation cross section
of these atoms agree excellently with the experimental values for 
low, medium and high photon--energies. For neon, discrepancies start 
to be noticeable for low and intermediate energy. An accurate 
photoionisation description of heavier atoms requires the inclusion 
of many--body effects that can be relevant, such as orbital 
relaxation due to the creation of a hole, collective response 
of inner shell electrons~\cite{Ederer1964} and correlation effects.

\section{Depurated Inversion Method for Molecules}

The depurated inversion method described above is extended here to 
determine effective potentials for molecules; methane is taken as an
example. Furthermore, the molecular description of CH$_4$ given by 
DIM is tested by computing two collisional processes within the FBA.

\subsection{Theory}

Without loss of generality, we will present the DIM theoretical grounds 
for hydride compounds. The Hamiltonian of an $N$--electron $X\!H_n$ 
molecule within the Born--Oppenheimer approximation is given by
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H}=-\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_{\mathbf{r}_i} 
 - \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Z_N}{r_i} 
 + \sum_{i=1}^N V_H(r_i)
 + \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{r_{ij}}\,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 V_H(r_i) = -\sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}_{H_j}\right|}\,,
\end{equation}
where $Z_N$ is the nuclear charge of the heavier atom, and 
$\mathbf{R}_{H_j}$ are the coordinates of the hydrogens respect to 
the $X$ atom. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation 
$\mathcal{H}\Psi=E\Psi$ is solved and the orbitals are expressed as
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:centralfield-wave}) considering the single--centre
expansion (SCE). The orbitals and energies are found by solving the 
Hartree--Fock equations. The computation of these 
equations generally relies on the use of finite basis sets for the 
representation of the molecular orbitals (MOs). Usually, the MOs are 
expressed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO),
\begin{equation}
 \Psi_i=\sum_j c_{ji} \phi_j\,,
\end{equation}
which can be constructed with Gaussian--type orbitals (GTO) basis 
sets. 

The inverted molecular potential expression, analogous to 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:V}), obtained from GTO basis sets present more 
difficulties than the atomic case. In addition to the asymptotic 
divergences and the poles, large unphysical oscillations 
arise~\cite{Schipper1997,Mura1997,Jacob2011,Gaiduk2013}. These 
prominent oscillations originate from undulations present in the MOs 
due to the finite number of the basis set. The second derivative, 
necessary to evaluate the inversion formula, amplifies these 
features~\cite{Schipper1997,Gaiduk2013}. In some cases, the 
oscillations are huge, e.g. near an electronegative atom like Cl. 
The appearance of these oscillations in the inverted potentials 
forces us to incorporate further actions in the depuration scheme. To 
illustrate this procedure, we consider the $1s$ orbital of the carbon 
atom. We solved the Hartree--Fock equations using the \mbox{6-311G} 
basis set with {\sc gamess} code~\cite{Schmidt1993,Gordon2005} and 
obtained inverted potentials by implementing Eq.~(\ref{eq:V}). 
The resulting $Z_{1s}^{\mbox{\scriptsize 6-311G}}$ charge is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:1sCarbon}a with a dot--dashed line. 
The charge oscillates significantly at low distances and diverges for 
higher $r$ values. The same calculation was 
repeated using the universal Gaussian basis set (UGBS), which has a 
more significant amount of primitives. The corresponding inverted 
charge $Z_{1s}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$ is exhibited in the figure 
with a dashed line. 
Although the charge still diverges around $r\approx1\,$a.u., the 
oscillations are now circumscribed near the nucleus.
Finally, the differential Hartree--Fock equations for the carbon 
atom were solved using the finite--differences (FD) method. 
The $1s$ inverted charge obtained with this procedure, 
$Z_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize FD}}$ (solid line), shows 
no oscillations since no basis sets have been used to construct the 
orbital; however, the charge still 
diverges for $r>1\,$a.u., as it usually does for all HF calculations.

\caption{(a) Effective charges for the $1s$ orbital of carbon. 
(b) Basis--set oscillation profiles.}
\label{fig:1sCarbon}
\end{figure}

The oscillations pattern will vary for each basis set used in the 
calculations. We may define oscillation profiles as 
\begin{equation}
 p_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize BS}} = Z_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize BS}}-
 Z_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize FD}} \,,
 \label{eq:oscillation-prof}
\end{equation}
where $Z_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize BS}}$ is the inverted charge of the 
atom using a particular basis set ``BS'' and 
$Z_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize FD}}$ is the effective charge obtained 
from the inversion of the finite--difference wavefunctions. In the 
previous example, the basis set considered for calculating the $1s$ 
orbital of carbon were \mbox{6-311G} and UGBS. The oscillation 
profiles for the $1s$ orbital, using Eq.~(\ref{eq:oscillation-prof}) 
for these basis sets, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1sCarbon}b. Since 
the orbital profiles for each atomic basis set are distinctive, once 
they are determined for the atomic case, they can be removed in 
further molecular calculations. An example of this procedure is given 
in the following Section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example: Methane}
\label{sec:dimmethane}

In order to illustrate the implementation of the DIM for molecules, 
we considered CH$_4$, which is highly symmetric, and therefore, can 
be described with an angular averaged potential~\cite{Granados2016}. 
We computed the HF molecular orbitals and energies of CH$_4$ 
employing the UGBS basis sets of carbon and hydrogen, which considers 
angular momenta up to $L=1$. Methane calculations with this basis set 
should include polarisation functions (at least d--functions) to 
increase the accuracy of the molecular 
energies~\cite{Rothenberg1971,Hariharan1972}. However, to isolate the 
effects of the basis set, we computed the atomic oscillation profiles 
and the molecular orbitals on the same footing. The charges obtained 
by direct inversion are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch4zeff} with dashed 
lines. Since the molecular orbitals are given by LCAO of carbon and 
hydrogen, the oscillations of the inverted charges are a consequence 
of the finite basis set of these atoms. To remove the most critical 
oscillations,  first, we must determine the oscillation profiles 
produced by the atomic carbon basis set. We use 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:oscillation-prof}) to determine the 
$p_{1s}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$, $p_{2s}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$ 
and $p_{2p}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$ profiles of carbon. Then, we 
remove the oscillations by subtracting the carbon 
$p_{nl}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$ profiles from the corresponding 
inverted charges $Z_{i}^{\mbox{\scriptsize UGBS}}$ of CH$_4$. The 
oscillations are removed for all orbitals except for the $2a_2$, 
which presents small oscillatory residues from the hydrogen basis 
set. Since the residual fluctuations are minimum and near the 
nucleus, we proceeded to implement the depuration scheme as described 
in Section~\ref{sec:DIM}. We define a new parametric DIM charge 
equation,
\begin{eqnarray}
 Z(r) = \sum_j Z_j e^{-\alpha_j r} 
 + Z_{\mbox{\scriptsize H}} e^{-(\ln r - \ln \beta)^2/(2\gamma)} 
 + 1\,.
 \label{eq:moleculezDIM}
\end{eqnarray}
In contrast to the approximation proposed for 
atoms~(\ref{eq:atomiczDIM}), a second term has been added to the 
formula to account for the presence of the hydrogens. This expression 
allows us to conveniently adjust both the location and width of the 
screened hydrogenic potential without affecting the correct charge value at the origin.
The optimised parameters for the methane molecule are given in 
Table~\ref{tab:ch4parameters}, and the corresponding DIM charges are 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch4zeff}, with solid lines. The orbital 
energies obtained with these charges are also given in the table.

\subsection{Collisional Processes}

The orientation of the molecular targets is important for determining
the cross sections of collisional processes. However, it is generally 
not pre--established in the experiments. Thus, the spherically 
averaged description of the system, assumed by the DIM potential 
makes sense. In the following, we examine two collisional processes 
in the first--order approximation: proton--impact ionisation and 
single photoionisation. 

\subsubsection{Proton--Impact Ionisation}

Results for the proton--impact ionisation cross section for CH$_4$,
calculated under the first Born approximation, are given in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ionch4}. The initial bound and the final continuum 
states of the molecule needed for the T--matrix computation 
(Eq.~(\ref{eq:transition-matrix})) were calculated with the DIM 
potentials from Section~\ref{sec:dimmethane}. The ionisation cross 
section for high and intermediate energies shows good agreement with 
the experimental results. The failure at low energies is attributed 
to the validity of the first Born approximation and not to our DIM 
approach.

\begin{figure}[H]

line: first--order DIM theoretical calculations. Symbols: experiments 
from Ref.~\cite{Rudd1983,Rudd1985}.}
\label{fig:ionch4}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Photoionisation}
\label{subsubsec:photoch4}

The photoionisation cross section for CH$_4$, calculated with the DIM 
potentials in a first order approximation, is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:photoch4} (solid lines). Good agreement with the 
experimental results (symbols) is found for high energy values and at 
the threshold. The curve between $\sim$15 and $\sim$300 eV shows the 
photoionisation from the outer $n=2$ shell, while the discontinuity 
at 300 eV corresponds to the threshold of the $1a_1$ inner shell 
orbital. For low and intermediate photon--energies, the agreement 
between our calculations and the experimental values from 
Ref.~\cite{Lukirskii1964,Henke1982,Samson1989} is not that good. 
Phenomena such as molecular orbital relaxation, possible collective 
contributions and correlation effects must be considered in further 
calculations. On the other hand, for the $1a_1$ inner shell
photoionisation, these effects are not significant, and we obtain a 
perfect agreement with the experimental results.

\section{Concluding remarks}

In this work, we explored the possibility of using pseudopotentials 
within the single electron model to calculate inelastic transitions. 
The first Born approximation was used to calculate proton--impact 
excitation, ionisation, electron capture and photoionisation. Two 
simple atoms were studied, having a single electron in the outer 
shell. For hydrogen, we found excellent agreement for all the 
collisional processes, for low and intermediate energies. In the case 
of lithium, the only process that can be calculated with reasonable 
accuracy is the proton--impact excitation. We concluded that the 
range of validity is restrained to minimal momentum transfers. 
The depurated inversion method, on the other hand, accurately 
reproduces photoionisation experimental results for many--electron 
atoms. 

We extended the DIM for molecular systems. In this case, the 
inversion procedure produces huge oscillations due to the finite size 
of the basis sets involved in the Hartree--Fock orbital calculations. 
An additional step is included during the depuration scheme. In order 
to determine the oscillation profile for a particular basis set, we 
computed the inverted atomic charges in a finite--differences 
framework. By subtracting the charges, it is possible to isolate the 
oscillations corresponding to this particular basis set. We used the 
DIM method to determine the effective potentials for CH$_4$. These 
potentials are implemented in first--order proton--impact ionisation
and photoionisation cross sections calculations. For both processes, 
we found good agreement with the experimental results. The main
discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that only first--order is 
considered in the perturbation theory.
