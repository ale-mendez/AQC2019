@article{Mendez2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. This work presents exchange potentials for specific orbitals calculated by inverting Hartree–Fock wavefunctions. This was achieved by using a Depurated Inversion Method. The basic idea of the method relies on the substitution of Hartree–Fock orbitals and eigenvalues into the Kohn–Sham equation. Through inversion, the corresponding effective potentials were obtained. Further treatment of the inverted potential should be carried on. The depuration is a careful optimization which eliminates the poles and also ensures the fullfilment of the appropriate boundary conditions. The procedure developed here is not restricted to the ground state or to a nodeless orbital and is applicable to all kinds of atoms. As an example, exchange potentials for noble gases and term-dependent orbitals of the lower configuration of Nitrogen are calculated. The method allows to reproduce the input energies and wavefunctions with a remarkable degree of accuracy.},

abstract = {In this work we show the results of a numerical experiment performed on the Hartree–Fock (HF) wave functions in order to understand the relationship between the positions of the orbital nodes and the inflection points (zeros of their second derivative). This analysis is equivalent to investigating the existence of a physical one-electron local potential representing the interactions between the electrons. We found that with successive improvements in the quality of the numerical methods, the nodes and the inflection points systematically become closer. When the nodes coincide exactly with the inflection points, the existence of an effective local potential would be proven. However, this requirement cannot be fulfilled unless an explicit constraint (missing in the standard method) is incorporated into the HF procedure. The depurated inversion method (DIM) was devised to obtain detailed nl-orbital potentials for atoms and molecules. The method is based on the inversion of Kohn–Sham-type equations, followed by a further careful optimization which eliminates singularities and also ensures the fulfillment of the appropriate boundary conditions. The orbitals resulting from these potentials have their internal inflection points located exactly at the nodes. In this way, the DIM can be employed to obtain effective potentials that accurately reproduce the HF orbitals.},

It is useful to note in this regard that GAMESS is a general-purpose suite of electronic structure and QM/MM methods (including open-and closed-shell Hartree–Fock which has been essentially ignored here) that can be run on virtually any computer, cluster, massively parallel system, or for that matter a desktop Mac or PC.

abstract = {Kohn-Sham effective potentials recovered from Gaussian-basis-set electron densities exhibit large oscillations and asymptotic divergences not found in exact potentials and in functional derivatives of approximate density functionals. We show that the detailed structure of these oscillations and divergences is almost exclusively determined by the basis set in terms of which the reference density is expressed, and is almost independent of the density-functional or wave function method used for computing the density. Based on this observation, we propose a smoothening scheme in which most basis-set artifacts in a Kohn-Sham potential recovered from a given density are removed by subtracting the oscillation profile of the exchange-only local-density approximation potential computed in the same basis set as the reference density. The correction allows one to obtain smooth Kohn-Sham potentials from electron densities even for small Gaussian basis sets and greatly reduces discrepancies between the original (input) density and the density obtained from the reconstructed potential.},

First, the evaluation of the functional derivative of orbital-dependent exchange-correlation functionals requires the application of optimized effective potential methods. Second, the optimization of the effective local potential that yields a given electron density is important both for the development of improved approximate functionals and for the practical application of embedding schemes based on DFT. However, in all cases this optimization turns into an ill-posed problem if a finite basis set is introduced for the Kohn–Sham orbitals. So far, this problem has not been solved satisfactorily. Here, a new approach to overcome the ill-posed nature of such finite-basis set methods is presented for the optimization of the effective local potential that yields a given electron density.

The goal of this chapter is to summarize and review the capability of this model to deal with fundamental magnitudes of the atomic collisions expressed as different moments of the energy loss: ionization cross sections (single or multiple, differential, and total), stopping power (and mean excitation energy), and energy loss straggling.

abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

abstract = {Proton and helium stopping cross sections were measured for the noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon, the diatomic gases hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen and for the molecules carbon dioxide and methane in the energy ranges 700 keV–2.1 MeV and 1.0–3.0 MeV, respectively. The statistical and systematical errors are between 1.0 and 1.5{\%} each. Optimum parameters for the Andersen-Ziegler semi-empirical formula were deduced for all data sets by means of the least-squares method. From the stopping cross sections of protons and 4He-ions at same velocity higher order Z1 corrections (Barkas-correction) for the noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe and the diatomic gases H2, N2 and O2 were calculated, using theoretical values for the Bloch-correction approximated by Bichsel and Porter. The experimental Z13-corrections were compared with the different theoretical predictions of Ashley, Ritchi and Brandt, Jackson and McCarthy and Lindhard and Esbensen.},

@article{Swint1970,
abstract = {Energy loss of protons in N2, air O2, Ne, Ar, Kr, CH4 and CO2 has been measured as a function of incident energy from 0.4 to 3.4 MeV. The incident beam of protons from a Van de Graaff accelerator was scattered from a thin gold foil into an isolated gas cell. A surface barrier solid state detector and a 512-channel pulse height analyzer were used to measure the energy of the protons after they had traversed the gas cell. The experimental results obtained have a probable error of 2–5{\%}. Comparison of these results has been made with available experimental results, Whaling's stopping power curves and the Lindhard-Scharff theory.},

@article{Baumgart1983,
abstract = {Helium stopping powers were measured for ten gases in the energy range between 0.1 and 1.1 MeV with a total accuracy of about 2.5{\%}. Additionally, the proton stopping powers in CO2 and CH4 were determined. Optimum parameters for the Andersen-Ziegler semi-empirical formula were deduced for all data sets by means of the least-squares method. Stopping-power ratios SHe/Sp were determined using proton stopping powers for H2, N2, O2 and the five inert gases which were measured recently with the same experimental set-up; they show a strong dependence on the target atomic number. The low-energy helium stopping cross sections were filted to the power function S = kEp. Experimental shell corrections were deduced from the measured helium stopping powers and compared with the theoretical shell corrections of Bonderup, whereby different higher-order Zl correction terms were included. The results show that in the energy range investigated it is not possible to obtain a consistent description for all gases.},

@article{Henke1982,
abstract = {The primary low-energy x-ray interactions within matter are photoabsorption and coherent scattering, which can be efficiently described for photon energies outside the threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. These may be uniquely determined through quantum dispersion relations from photoabsorption data. With the available fittings of the photoabsorption cross sections and with a new compilation of such data for the region 30–300 eV, continuous sets of the photoabsorption cross sections from 30 to 10 000 eV have been determined for 94 elements. With these, for the region 100–2000 eV, atomic scattering factors which are independent of scattering angle and which include the relatively strong anomalous dispersion structures have been obtained. Methods are reviewed and currently important examples of the application of atomic scattering factors to the detailed characterization of selected x-ray mirror monochromators and of Bragg multilayer and crystal analyzers for low-energy x-ray analysis are presented.},
